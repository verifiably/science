# Glossary

Terms are defined in their Science-specific sense. Follow the topic link for
context and the linked design references for normative detail.

- **Address** — A canonical lookup key, `kind:<basis-digest>`, distinct from
  label, location, and historical continuity. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#identity-is-not-one-field))
- **Analysis spec** — An immutable preregistered plan naming a proposition,
  estimand, interpretation, inputs, parameters, nondeterminism, and equivalence
  rule for an assessment run. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#the-analysis-spec-freezes-the-scientific-plan))
- **Applicability** — The scope an estimand licenses, declared in the spec and
  possibly narrower than the proposition it targets. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#the-analysis-spec-freezes-the-scientific-plan))
- **Assessment** — A run-derived result that evaluates one proposition and is
  the only record kind allowed to enter empirical belief. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#assessments-are-the-only-empirical-route))
- **Belief** — A policy-bound computed view over a complete set of eligible,
  directional, independence-filtered assessments; v1 returns a signed integer.
  ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-belief-is-a-reproducible-view))
- **Belief input digest** — The identity of the exact world, records, standing,
  rules, and bindings consulted by a belief computation. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-belief-is-a-reproducible-view))
- **Canonical projection** — The prescribed meaning-bearing representation
  hashed for an identity, excluding presentation and location fields.
  ([foundations](foundations.md#contracts-compile-into-profiles))
- **Claim** — The opaque runtime value of a proposition after its operator,
  arguments, qualifiers, polarity, and layer pass the active profile.
  ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-claim-is-typed-by-its-operator))
- **Claim layer** — Which kind of claim a proposition makes — causal,
  structural, statistical, or methodological. The base contract fixes the set,
  each operator declares which layers it may inhabit, and the layer enters claim
  identity. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-claim-is-typed-by-its-operator))
- **Clean-environment verification** — A passed comparison of equal recipes
  with qualifying fresh-environment and confinement evidence; the only scope
  that can admit an assessment. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#replay-verification-and-belief-are-different-decisions))
- **Conformance cut** — A prospectively selected subset of guarantee assertion
  arms that one implementation slice can exercise without crossing an
  undesigned boundary. ([adoption](contracts-and-adoption.md#adoption-follows-legal-partial-states))
- **Contract cut** — An immutable, content-addressed version of the normative
  Science contract and its exact oracle-case identities. ([contracts](contracts-and-adoption.md#designs-explain-contract-cuts-will-govern))
- **Corpus** — An admitted collection with a durable opaque `corpus_id`, a
  profile-pinning manifest, and identity-changing states. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#there-is-one-world-projects-are-views))
- **Corpus state identity** — A digest of the complete canonical corpus manifest
  plus the sorted identities of its nodes. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#there-is-one-world-projects-are-views))
- **Coreference attestation** — An attributed, additive record that two
  distinctly identified records of one kind are believed to name one thing. Its
  stance is `+1` or `-1`, its weight is one regardless of who authored it, and the
  pair's balance is derived rather than stored. A positive balance activates a
  query-layer coreference edge; nothing merges.
  ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#correction-is-additive))
- **Dataset-production run** — A run shape that transforms data and produces one
  dataset without a proposition, spec, or assessment. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#one-run-kind-has-two-shapes))
- **Domain contract** — A namespaced declaration of domain sorts, operators,
  qualifier dimensions, facets, and vocabulary bindings. ([foundations](foundations.md#contracts-compile-into-profiles))
- **Epoch** — An immutable world-index publication over explicit corpus states,
  world records, rules, and derivation receipts. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#the-world-index-is-a-named-covered-view))
- **Estimand** — What quantity an analysis estimates, and at what scope. Frozen
  in the analysis spec and copied into the assessment rather than authored
  there. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#the-analysis-spec-freezes-the-scientific-plan))
- **Facet** — A named block of typed fields carried by a record. Base-profile
  facets are unnamespaced; domain facets are namespaced and may extend
  interpretation without redefining kernel relations. A dataset's
  empirical-observation facet is what lets a run's `observes` edge confer
  eligibility. ([foundations](foundations.md#contracts-compile-into-profiles))
- **Declared** — A dataset carrying a content identity without a matching byte
  observation of every resource it declares. A world entity, authorable and
  referenceable, and never belief-eligible. Not the same as *unheld*: a run that
  looked in one place and found nothing has measured its own coverage. The
  route out is a matching holdings observation (G9).
  ([foundations](foundations.md#the-epistemic-invariant))
- **Held** — Exactly reproducible bytes available on demand under a content
  identity; not a synonym for raw, public, local, or checked into Git. Distinct
  from **declared**, which has the identity and not the bytes. Derived from
  active **holdings observations** under a declared coverage since
  2026-08-10.
  ([foundations](foundations.md#the-epistemic-invariant))
- **Holdings observation** — A world record of what one act found at one
  canonical location: `found` with an algorithm-qualified digest, or
  `absent` where a completed dereference answered. Act-minted, append-only,
  revised only by supersession, never expired by age; heldness is derived
  from the active observations under a declared coverage.
  ([holdings design](../designs/2026-08-10-verified-holdings-record-design.md))
- **Identity basis** — The kind-specific semantic fields whose canonical
  projection determines a record's content identity. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#identity-is-not-one-field))
- **Independence** — A pairwise, three-valued judgment derived from complete
  dataset-lineage closure: independent, shared-source, or not-certified.
  ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#assessments-are-the-only-empirical-route))
- **Instrument certification** — A recomputable witness that a specific rule and
  implementation binding conforms and can reach its required outcomes.
  ([contracts](contracts-and-adoption.md#rules-bind-meaning-to-the-code-that-ran))
- **Interpretation rule** — The versioned rule identity, frozen in the spec,
  that maps a run's result to the assessment's outcome. It is declared before
  the result exists. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#the-analysis-spec-freezes-the-scientific-plan))
- **Label** — A human-facing name computed on read from immutable record content
  and a pinned authority snapshot. It is never stored, never part of identity, and
  never resolved against.
  ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#identity-is-not-one-field))
- **Mutation log** — A per-root hash-linked chain registering boundary
  transactions and destructive intent, with heads observed outside their own
  deletable set. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#mutation-history-is-detectable-relative-to-observers))
- **NoBelief** — A successful answer saying belief cannot be produced because
  inputs are unavailable, no assessment is eligible, or only non-directional
  outcomes remain. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-belief-is-a-reproducible-view))
- **Operator** — A contract-declared claim predicate whose arity, argument
  sorts, qualifiers, polarity aptitude, and layers determine valid claims.
  ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-claim-is-typed-by-its-operator))
- **Oracle** — A frozen guarantee obligation identified by a permanent label
  and made executable through a check plus a mutation that must break it.
  ([contracts](contracts-and-adoption.md#every-oracle-must-be-falsifiable))
- **Policy binding** — The required pair of belief-policy rule identity and
  implementation content identity used for one belief computation.
  ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-belief-is-a-reproducible-view))
- **Profile** — The runtime specification compiled from one Science base
  contract and the domain contracts pinned by a corpus manifest.
  ([foundations](foundations.md#contracts-compile-into-profiles))
- **Proposition** — An immutable record whose semantic identity is its typed
  claim structure, not its prose rendering. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#structure-not-prose-determines-identity))
- **Qualifier** — A restriction on one of an operator's declared dimensions,
  sorted exactly as an argument is. The v1 fragment is flat: one restriction per
  dimension, with a quantifier. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-claim-is-typed-by-its-operator))
- **Reads** — A run-input role for literature, configuration, ontologies, and
  other context that never confers empirical eligibility. ([foundations](foundations.md#closed-routes-inert-by-default))
- **Refused** — A fail-early boundary outcome for malformed, contradictory, or
  out-of-contract input; it never guesses or repairs. ([foundations](foundations.md#valid-transitions-refuse-audit-detects-bypasses))
- **Retraction** — An immutable, attributed record that subtracts an exact
  target's standing at read time without deleting or modifying it.
  ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#correction-is-additive))
- **Rule binding** — The exact pair of a fixture-defined rule identity and the
  held implementation content identity that executed it. ([contracts](contracts-and-adoption.md#rules-bind-meaning-to-the-code-that-ran))
- **Run** — A complete immutable execution closure consisting of a recipe,
  result, and occurrence. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#a-run-has-three-complete-parts))
- **Sort** — The type of referent a slot admits. Operators declare a sort per
  argument position and per qualifier dimension, so a term of one sort cannot
  fill a slot of another. ([claims](claims-and-belief.md#a-claim-is-typed-by-its-operator))
- **Source assertion** — A record of what a source asserts, denies, or
  hypothesizes about a proposition; it is useful but has no edge into belief.
  ([foundations](foundations.md#the-epistemic-invariant))
- **Standing** — The active status calculated from an acyclic retraction graph,
  including counter-retractions, rather than stored as a mutable flag.
  ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#correction-is-additive))
- **Supersession** — An additive relation naming a replacement or continuation;
  unlike retraction, it does not subtract the predecessor's standing.
  ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#correction-is-additive))
- **UID** — A durable continuity identifier used when addresses change through
  correction, or when duplicate storage is consolidated. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#identity-is-not-one-field))
- **Verification** — An immutable comparison of two runs under a frozen
  equivalence rule, with a derived scope and verdict. ([computation](computation-and-reproducibility.md#replay-verification-and-belief-are-different-decisions))
- **World** — The union of admitted corpora and world-level records; projects
  are views over it, not separate epistemic universes. ([identity](identity-world-and-change.md#there-is-one-world-projects-are-views))
