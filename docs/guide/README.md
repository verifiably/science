# Science contributor guide

Science records scientific claims, the computations that assess them, and the
exact inputs needed to explain a belief. This guide is the short path into the
redesign. It explains the model by topic; the linked design documents and their
frozen guarantee identifiers remain authoritative.

## The system in six ideas

1. **A world holds immutable records.** Corpora contribute records to a world;
   content identity and explicit addresses keep references stable.
2. **A profile defines what records may mean.** The Science base contract and
   selected domain contracts compile into the runtime profile.
3. **A proposition is a typed claim.** Its operator, arguments, qualifiers,
   polarity, and layer determine semantic identity; prose does not.
4. **A run captures a complete execution.** Its predeclared spec, held inputs,
   code, environment, parameters, and outputs form a reproducible closure.
5. **A reproduced assessment may bear on belief.** Literature can orient and
   assert, but only eligible assessments of held observations enter empirical
   belief.
6. **History is additive.** Supersession, retraction, and mutation logs preserve
   prior records while changing what is active, standing, or demonstrably intact.

```text
held observations → run → assessment ──assesses──▶ typed proposition → belief
literature corpus → source assertion ────────────▶ typed proposition   (no belief edge)
contracts + corpus manifest → compiled profile ──governs every boundary above
```

## Read in this order

1. [Foundations](foundations.md) — the invariant, kernel, and ownership model.
2. [Claims and belief](claims-and-belief.md) — what propositions and belief
   values mean.
3. [Identity, world, and change](identity-world-and-change.md) — how records are
   named, found, corrected, and protected against silent removal.
4. [Computation and reproducibility](computation-and-reproducibility.md) — what a
   run captures and what replay proves.
5. [Contracts and adoption](contracts-and-adoption.md) — how the design becomes
   executable conformance work.

Use the [glossary](glossary.md) for quick definitions and the consolidated
[open questions](open-questions.md) for unresolved design edges.

## Status and authority

The guide deliberately does not copy a changing implementation tally. The
[adoption ledger](../designs/2026-08-03-redesign-adoption-ledger.md#3-order-of-work)
is the sole authority for what is built, what remains design-only, and what
waits on another artifact. If this guide disagrees with a source design, the
source wins.

One boundary is worth knowing before you read further, because no page below
covers it. The redesign was cut into seven sub-problems, and **two of them have
no design yet**: the *agentic surface* — how humans and agents actually curate,
including audit liveness and the divergence table — and *salvage*, which asks
how the predecessor's pipelines, notes, and results are re-situated rather than
migrated. The first is the corpus's largest structural deferral. Everything the
five topic pages describe sits below those two, so a question that sounds like
"but how would anyone use this day to day" is usually landing in the gap rather
than in something the guide failed to explain.
([kernel §10](../designs/2026-08-02-epistemic-kernel-design.md#10-not-in-scope--the-remaining-six-sub-problems))

## Maintaining the guide

A commit that banks or amends a design, or changes implementation state in the
ledger, must update the affected guide pages and their `updated` dates in the
same commit. Use inline Markdown links rather than reference-style definitions
so `python/tools/check_guide.py` can inspect every local target.
