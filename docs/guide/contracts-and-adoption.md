# Contracts and adoption

## TL;DR

Frozen guarantee identifiers become executable, mutation-tested obligations in
immutable contract cuts; adoption proceeds in dependency-ordered slices, and the
living ledger—not this guide—is the authority for what has actually landed.

## Why it matters

A large design can look complete while its strongest claims remain untested, or
a partial implementation can quietly redefine success around what was easiest
to build. Science counters both risks: guarantees keep stable names, every
conformance check must demonstrate how it fails, and each implementation slice
is selected prospectively at a fully designed boundary.

## Key ideas

### Designs explain; contract cuts will govern

The design corpus records rationale, alternatives, amendments, and declared
limits. The normative contract design specifies a smaller immutable artifact
containing kinds and identities, operations and outcomes, rule bindings,
conformance oracles, and change policy. Once the first normative contract cut
exists, drift is resolved in the contract's favor; earlier designs remain the
history explaining why the rule exists.

A contract identity hashes its exact canonical normative bytes. Any byte change
mints a successor that names its predecessor. A readable version is only an
alias. Frozen oracle identifiers—such as G3, W8a, R12, M10, and P4—are never
renumbered, so reviews and tests can point to the obligation more precisely than
to a mutable section number.

### Rules bind meaning to the code that ran

A rule identity is `(symbol, fixture-set identity)`: fixtures are the normative
definition of behavior. A held implementation that passes those fixtures is the
operational half. The exact pair of rule identity and implementation content
identity enters every derived result, because finite fixtures cannot guarantee
that two implementations agree on every unseen input.

Interpretation, equivalence, and scope-derivation instruments may also receive
an immutable certification. Certification recomputes witnesses showing that a
specific binding both conforms and reaches all required outcomes. Missing or
retracted certification does not block use; it caps downstream scope at
`not-certified`, making the limit visible to admission rules.

### Every oracle must be falsifiable

The guarantee tables are intended to become a conformance suite. Each oracle
row names a source mutation that should make its exact check fail. A check that
cannot fail, no longer reaches the mutated code, points to an uncollectable test,
or was already failing before mutation is malformed contract content—not a
successful guard.

The first implementation made this discipline executable with an N2 harness.
It applies each declared mutation to an isolated copy and distinguishes sound
arms from `vacuous`, `stale`, and `uncollected` ones. Ten of its first forty arms
were defective, demonstrating why a green ordinary suite alone is not enough.

### Adoption follows legal partial states

The [adoption ledger](../designs/2026-08-03-redesign-adoption-ledger.md#3-order-of-work)
orders work by actual dependencies. Designs can bank before their dependencies
are implemented; an implementation slice may cross only the boundaries it can
exercise and must leave the rest explicitly deferred. The clean-start ruling
also forbids mechanical predecessor migration and compatibility machinery:
records are reproduced through the new typed boundaries.

Conformance cut 1 was frozen before implementation. It selected eleven of 126
then-banked guarantee rows—six wholly and five only at named assertion arms—and
classified the other 115 by the subsystem that would unblock them. The corpus now
holds 139 rows across eleven frozen tables: the belief policy's P1–P9 banked the
day the cut was drawn, and the admission ramp appended G9 on 2026-08-09 while
narrowing W3's dataset arm. The cut's stop rule was the last fully designed seam:
typed claim construction, projection, identity, decode, and cross-language
parity, with no persistence boundary and no belief computation.

[Conformance cut 2](../designs/2026-08-09-conformance-cut-2.md) was frozen
2026-08-09 on the same discipline, before its slice was built, and gives the
ten post-cut-1 rows their owner. Its slice landed the same day, and the
selection required no amendment. It is drawn at the belief seam — the derived
admission state, the assessment admission gate, the belief input closure digest,
and `science.belief.v1` under an exact binding — selecting 13 rows in full and
11 at named assertion arms, and classifying the remaining 108 deferred rows by the
subsystem that unblocks them. The admission ramp's three open questions are its
stated boundary conditions: verified-holdings observations enter as supplied
arguments precisely because where they are recorded is still undesigned, no arm
reads an observation's timestamp, and the partly-pinned fixtures exercise a
ruled boundary without corroborating the ruling. A second reader reviewed the
selection adversarially before the freeze, and every arm its findings moved,
they moved out.

### Measurements constrain the next slice

The eight-corpus survey and three-corpus typing exercise are measurements, not
conformance oracles. They showed that fitted vocabulary can type mm30's 307
structured propositions, but only one surveyed corpus meaningfully exercises
the calculus; no surveyed record exercises qualifiers. They also prevented
readerless or unexercised vocabulary from entering the base profile.

Measurements therefore narrow claims and reveal prerequisites. They do not
change implementation status, expand a frozen cut after the fact, or turn a
fitted result into independent validation.

## How it connects

- [Foundations](foundations.md) defines the ownership and transition boundaries
  to which contracts give executable form.
- [Claims and belief](claims-and-belief.md) explains M1–M13, P1–P9, and the
  corpus measurements summarized here.
- [Identity, world, and change](identity-world-and-change.md) supplies immutable
  contract succession, standing, epochs, and audit inputs.
- [Computation and reproducibility](computation-and-reproducibility.md) uses
  exact rule bindings and instrument certification in runs and verifications.

## Current state

The ledger records conformance cut 1 and the multi-corpus typing exercise as
landed work. Conformance cut 2 is frozen and its slice landed 2026-08-09: the
derived admission state, the assessment admission gate, the belief input
closure digest, and `science.belief.v1` under an exact binding. The
normative-contract design is banked, but a complete normative contract cut,
instrument certification, persistence, run capture, world index, and mutation
log remain outside both cuts. Consult the ledger for the current state rather
than carrying these sentences into a status report.

The contributor guide has no ledger artifact of its own. That is deliberate:
it documents the system, does not implement a system boundary, and no adoption
item waits on it.

## Open edges

See [Contracts and adoption](open-questions.md#contracts-and-adoption) for
contract governance, the normative artifact's shape, certifying instruments that
already exist, how the next cut is selected, and the residue the admission ramp
left behind when it closed. The writer
model sits with the other authority questions under
[Identity, world, and change](open-questions.md#identity-world-and-change).
