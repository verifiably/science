"""N2 — every oracle row can fail, applied to cut 1's own selected arms.

The harness runs each declared arm twice: once unsabotaged, where its checks must
**pass**, and once with its sabotage applied, where they must **fail**. Both
directions are needed and neither is decoration.

* Without the first, a check that can never pass looks like a sound arm.
* Without the second, the arm asserts nothing about the property it names.

**One test function at a time, and only exit code 1 counts.** Every part of that
was learned by getting it wrong. Running an arm's checks in a single `pytest`
invocation and reading one exit code makes a failing check cover for a passing
one — three real arms in this table were carrying a check that passed under their
own sabotage, and the arm scored sound on the strength of the other. Splitting
the invocation is not enough either, because a **class node** is one invocation
over many tests wearing a node id, and reintroduces the same aggregation through
the check rather than the runner. And *"exited non-zero"* is not *"the check
failed"*: `pytest` exits **4** when it cannot collect the node id, so a sabotage
coarse enough to break the module's syntax, or a check that has been renamed
away, scores as a failing check while demonstrating only that unimportable code
does not import.

A sabotage is applied to a **copy** of the package, and the checks run in a
subprocess against it. Nothing writes to the working tree, which is what makes it
safe to run these concurrently and safe to interrupt — the hand-run matrices this
replaces mutated files in place and restored them in a `finally`, one `SIGINT`
away from leaving a sabotaged source on disk.

**Four findings, not one.** An arm can be `sound`, `vacuous` — a check passed
under its own sabotage — `uncollected`, where a check never ran at all, or
`stale`, where the sabotage no longer matches the code it was written against.
Staleness happened twice during this build, and a stale sabotage is
indistinguishable from a passing arm unless it is looked for: the mutation
silently does nothing, the checks pass, and the harness reports the arm healthy.
Each is malformed contract content in the same way vacuity is, so each is
reported the same way.
