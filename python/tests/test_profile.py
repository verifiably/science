    """Provenance is necessary and is not sufficient.

    Nothing in this class is forged. Every brand is intact, every parser ran on a
    real document, and the claim that came out stood on a layer the compiled base
    contract does not declare. A domain's layer selections are validated
    **once**, at parse time, against whatever base it was handed, and the
    compiled operator then carries them as facts that nothing revalidates.

    The general shape is worth more than the instance: authenticating each input
    separately says nothing about whether the inputs **belong together**. It
    applies to an artifact whose **validity is conditional** on a particular
    upstream artifact and which **may later be recombined independently** — both
    true of a domain contract, whose layers were checked against one base and
    which is handed to `compile_profile` separately from any base. Such a
    boundary must either verify a recorded dependency or revalidate the relation.
    A stage that rechecks its inputs owes neither, which is why this is not a
    demand that every transformation carry provenance.
