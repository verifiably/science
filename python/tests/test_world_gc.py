"""Whole-epoch garbage collection: §9's explicit `delete_epoch`.

**Deletion is consumer policy, and it is whole-epoch.** Nothing in the package
calls it, nothing schedules it, and there is no act whose subject is one member
of one epoch. An epoch is published by one transaction and removed by one
transaction, and the arms below assert both halves of that: the plan holds a
`DeleteOp` for each of the eleven members and nothing else, and no production
module reaches the act at all.

**The refusals come before the transaction, and in a fixed order.** Under one
acquisition of the world lock the act crosses the recovery barrier, reads
`current`, refuses the epoch the pointer names, and only then opens the target.
Every one of those refusals leaves the world byte-for-byte as it found it,
which is what the plan-count and tree comparisons below are for.

**Every carrier the report is computed over is read the strong way.** The
sever report answers "does another retained epoch still carry this identity?",
so it has to read those epochs — and §8.1's rule is that an epoch this world
cannot read refuses the act reading it. A damaged epoch *elsewhere* therefore
refuses the whole deletion, exactly as it refuses a rule removal: a report
computed over a scan that skipped one would be the silent unresolvability §4.3
exists to prevent.

**The emptied directory is nonsemantic, and that has teeth.** §9 leaves the
directory behind. An empty directory read as a carrier would be a carrier
missing all eleven members, so one deletion would make every later scan of
``epochs/`` refuse and would make §9's own "a repeated deletion raises
`EpochUnknown`" report `EpochMalformed` instead. Two arms hold that door open:
the sever scan still runs after a deletion, and the deleted bytes can be
published back into the directory they were deleted from.
