"""Corpus-level guards over `docs/designs/`.

Three drift classes were found by hand on 2026-08-08, and each one is a fact that
lives in many documents while being owned by none of them:

* **`atoms` adoption state.** Plan A through A8 and Plan B items 1–2 are
  implemented; this file names every live document that still gates on a
  completed Plan A stage.
* **The guarantee-row inventory.** Thirteen frozen tables carry the acceptance
  criteria. Their counts are quoted in the README and in the review-disposition
  record, and nothing recomputed them when the belief policy added a table.
* **Cross-references.** Designs cite each other by filename. A rename or a typo is
  invisible to a reader who does not follow the link.

These are guards over *documents*, not over behaviour, and they hold only the
mechanical half. Whether a limitation is still true is review work; whether the
document it defers to exists is not.
