"""Cut 4's fixture acts.

Three acts do this cut's construction work, and only the first is portable:

* the **raw filesystem write** — §4.2.1's untrusted import. A fixture act and
  never a slice operation: it is how S7's corpus-check half, S8's negative,
  R19(d)/(e)'s read-side nondetection, R22's at-the-address forgery and R23's
  basis/composition disagreement are built at all. Nothing in `science` writes
  this way;
* the **durable mint** through the add path on the certified tuple, walked back
  out through the read surface after reload — the acceptance command's;
* the **uncertified-tuple refusal** — also the acceptance command's.

**A raw write is invisible to a live corpus**, which indexes at construction.
Every assertion about one reads through a **fresh** facade, which is what
`reopen` is for: reconstruction from disk is the recovery posture the seam
names, and it is the read this cut actually runs.
