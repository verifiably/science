"""Coherent preflight and corpus capture: §5.2 and §5.3, exercised end to end.

**What a build is here, and what it deliberately is not.** This module covers
everything up to — and stopping exactly at — the frozen build draft. Preflight
runs under the world lock and answers "may this build run at all, over exactly
these corpora, with exactly these four rules"; capture then enters each covered
corpus's capture hold in sorted order and takes, under that one exclusion, the
corpus's chain head, its corpus-state identity, one enumeration of its stored
nodes, and the state identity again. Publication is Task 9's and appears here
only as an absence to assert: a refused build writes nothing.

**The refusals are ordered, and the order is asserted rather than assumed.**
Several arms below construct a world with two faults at once and pin which one
the build reports. That is not pedantry: a build that reported the second fault
would be a build that inspected a registry, or ran a rule's fixtures, before it
knew the coverage was admissible.

**Concurrency here is event-driven.** Every arm that needs two threads gates
them with `threading.Event` and bounded `join`, and the seams that block are
the injected chain callback and the enumeration helper. No arm sleeps: a sleep
would turn "the capture refused without waiting" into "the capture refused
within a second", which is a different and much weaker claim.
