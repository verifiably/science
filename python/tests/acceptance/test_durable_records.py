"""R19 and R22 over the durable store: what a read does, and what it does not.

Both rows are about the **read side**. Cut 3 could state them only over value
sets; here a record lands at an address and reloads, so *"not refused"* and
*"the reader said nothing"* are assertions about a read that runs.

**Heldness stays exactly what cut 3 made it** — a value a fixture supplies.
Nothing is mounted, nothing is acquired, and no managed deletion runs: making
artifacts unreachable *here* while a copy remains held elsewhere is a statement
about the observations supplied to the call, which is the only place this slice
represents heldness at all.
