"""N2 over cut 4's own selected arms.

The doctrine is already load-bearing inside cut 4's reading — it is what refuses
S4's vacuous form and what excludes G5 — so declaring this cut's arms is the
obligation the reading has been discharging in prose, not a new one.

**The audit runs here rather than in the portable harness**, and that placement
is the claim: most of cut 4's arms are durable, their checks name
`acceptance/…` node ids, and an audit that could pass off the certified tuple
would be scoring arms that never wrote to a store. `test_n2.py` keeps auditing
cuts 1–3 exactly as it did, portably, and neither file changes the other's
table.
