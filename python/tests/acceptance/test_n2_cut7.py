"""N2 over cut 7's 48 frozen epoch-carrier arms, and the acceptance nodes four of them name.

**Four things live here and they are not the same thing.**

1. **The declaration accounting.** `docs/designs/2026-08-20-conformance-cut-7.md`
   is the frozen authority: §3's `Selected` and `Labeled` bullets *are* the unit
   inventory, and §4 states the row accounting. `TestTheCut7InventoryIsExact`
   parses both out of that file and reconciles them against `CUT7_ARMS`, so a
   declaration table that drifted from the cut fails here rather than being
   recounted by hand at close-out.

2. **The N2 audit.** Every arm is run twice — unsabotaged, where its check must
   pass, and sabotaged, where it must fail — through the shared harness. Unlike
   cut 6, nothing is pinned to a historical tree: cut 7's arms are declared
   against the package as it stands, so both directions read the working tree.

3. **The acceptance nodes.** Four arms name a node in this module. Three are
   durable and run on the certified tuple through
   `tests/acceptance/conftest.py`'s gate: publication's committed registration
   entry, the recovery barrier's refusal to select a partial epoch, and the
   rule-install / rule-removal / GC-deletion transactions' entries. The fourth,
   `test_anchored_head_describes_the_captured_corpus_view`, is portable and is
   not a declared check — it is the **witness** X9's relocated-head arm is
   measured against, and §6.1 finding 6 is why it exists.

4. **The acceptance surface itself**, which is wider than the declarations. The
   *portable journey* walks one world end to end — four shipped rules held
   explicitly, two corpora admitted, two epochs published and read back, all
   four receipts validated, every arm of §8.3's resolution union and every
   §8.4 edge state this slice can reach, then the rule removal and the
   whole-epoch deletion with their sever reports — and asserts nothing about
   crashes. `test_published_anchors_name_the_committed_chains` is its durable
   counterpart: the anchored triples, compared against the engine's own
   committed entries rather than against the callback that produced them.
   Neither is a declared check; both are what `tools/cut7_acceptance.py`
   discharges the cut by running.

**Why the witness exists.** Cut 7 §3.1 requires the head-relocation sabotage to
interpose a real corpus write between the state capture and the relocated head
capture, "since without an interleaved write the sabotage passes vacuously",
and pins that vacuousness check to N2 declaration time. The declared check for
that arm is instrumented — it watches the operation lock — so it sees the
relocation itself and would fail either way. The witness sees only the
*consequence*: it compares the head the epoch anchored with the corpus state
the epoch captured, which is exactly the coherence the row is about. Under
relocation alone the witness passes, and that is the vacuity;
`TestTheRelocatedHeadSabotageIsNotVacuous` demonstrates both directions.
