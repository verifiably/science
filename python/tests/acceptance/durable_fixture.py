"""The records cut 4's durable arms are asserted over, minted through the add
path into one registered corpus root.

Everything here goes through `CorpusWriter.add` — no raw write, no edit, no
deletion. Where an arm needs a state the add path does not produce, the arm
itself constructs it with the raw-write act; where it needs a state a deletion
*would* produce, it is **minted** instead, which is what §3's add-only reading
makes selectable: a basis entry naming an address no record carries is a state,
not a transition.
