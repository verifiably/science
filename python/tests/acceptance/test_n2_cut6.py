"""N2 over cut 6's 22 frozen world-registry arms.

**The sabotage direction is audited against the commit that discharged cut 6.**
Cut 6's declarations name `world.py`, and slice 2 promoted that module to the
`science/world/` package. The declaration table and both runners are frozen, and
the design forbids recreating `world.py` as a shim: cut 6's committed sabotage
paths "remain historical evidence; no file is recreated to satisfy them". So the
sabotage half of the audit runs against the repository as it stood at
`CUT6_SOURCE_COMMIT` — the pre-promotion tree the 22 arms were written against,
package and suite together, because a sabotage of the historical package has to
be checked by the tests that shipped with it.

**The live tree is still audited, by the other direction.**
`test_every_check_resolves_and_passes_without_the_sabotage` runs every declared
check against the working tree with no sabotage and no override, so a check that
is renamed away, or that stops passing because slice-2 work broke the behaviour
it names, still turns this module red. What the pin gives up is narrower and
worth stating plainly: weakening a *current* check — leaving its name and its
green result in place while removing what it asserts — is no longer caught here,
because the mutation direction now reads the historical copy of that check.
