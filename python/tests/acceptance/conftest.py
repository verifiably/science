"""The certified-tuple gate.

Everything under `tests/acceptance` runs against the **real engine on a real
volume**, and the gate below **errors** when that volume's configuration tuple
is not certified. It never skips, and the distinction is the whole point: a
skip reports green for a guarantee that was not exercised, and an environment
where durability cannot be exercised must not be able to report cut-4 discharge.

**The work directory has to sit on the certified volume**, which the platform
temporary directory generally does not — `/tmp` is a tmpfs on most hosts, and a
tmpfs has no barrier-option table at all. So the default is a directory beside
the checkout, and `SCIENCE_CUT4_ROOT` overrides it for a host that keeps its
certified volume elsewhere.
