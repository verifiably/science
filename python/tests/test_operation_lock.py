"""`OperationLock`'s five states, driven by events and gates only.

Nothing here sleeps. Every wait and every join is bounded and asserted, because
a sleep long enough to "let the other thread get there" is a hope, not a
synchronization primitive: it passes on a quiet machine and lies on a busy one.

The one case that needs a queued writer to wake *after* a whole capture has
begun and ended cannot be reached by hoping to win a race either. It is reached
by wrapping the condition's own mutex (`GatedLock`), which is the exact place a
notified waiter must pass through before it can look at the lock's state.
