"""S6(a)–(g): only certified independence confers multiplicity.

Arm (h) — the weak-D/strong-B regression — is recorded, not run: its own
amended text makes it a named acceptance condition binding the first successor
policy that admits unequal weights, and under v1's unit weight the case cannot
be constructed (cut 2 §4.2). What binds v1 today is P5, below.
