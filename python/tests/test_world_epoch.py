"""Publishing an epoch, and opening one back: §6 and §8.1's carrier half.

**What an epoch is here.** Eleven deterministic closed documents in one
content-addressed directory, created by exactly one world-root transaction
together with the one-line `current` pointer beside it. The directory's name is
the digest of the members it holds, computed from the complete bytes *before*
anything is written, so the name is a claim the bytes themselves settle. Every
arm below turns on that: a member edited by hand does not merely disagree with
a stored digest, it makes the directory misnamed.

**The two layers §8.2 separates, exercised as two layers.** The carrier layer
refuses an epoch whose member set, YAML, or packaging identity is wrong. It
does *not* refuse a receipt whose document parses and then violates §7.5's
contract — that receipt opens, reaches Task 10's validator, and evaluates as
``malformed`` there. One arm below publishes a contract-violating receipt into
a well-formed carrier and proves it opens, because a carrier layer that
refused it would close the path §8.2 exists to keep open.

**Concurrency is event-driven.** The interleaving arms gate a transaction
half-applied and prove a reader blocks rather than reading the applied prefix.
Nothing sleeps: a sleep would turn "the reader could not observe it" into "the
reader did not observe it within a second".
