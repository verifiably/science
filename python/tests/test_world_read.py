"""Bound reads through a published epoch: §8.3's resolution and §8.4's edges.

**Every answer names the publication it came from.** A read through an epoch is
not a read of the world; it is a read of what one publication observed, over
the coverage that publication declared. So every answer carries
`BoundStamp(packaging_identity, coverage)`, and the stamp means exactly "from
this publication over this declared coverage" and nothing more. Nothing here
measures how much has changed since capture, and nothing here is allowed to
imply that nothing has.

**Absence and ignorance are different answers.** `NotPresent` says "this
epoch recorded that address and the corpus carrying it is not here";
`Unknown` says "this epoch never observed it at all". A retired address is
*recorded*, so its corpus going away is the first of those and never the
second. And neither is ever how ambiguity or corruption is reported: a
duplicate carrier, an unreadable manifest, or a present carrier that does not
produce the mapped `uid` raises `ResolutionRefused`, because an answer that let
corruption look like absence would be worse than no answer.

**Coreference edges answer only where the inputs are established.** The
querying world's span is the live `corpus_id` set the registry reduces to — not
the roots it happens to be configured with — and an edge is `active` or
`inactive` only where the coreference receipt validated *and* the epoch's
coverage contains that whole span. Anything else is `indeterminate`, and an
expansion that would traverse such an edge refuses by name rather than
quietly treating it as inactive.
