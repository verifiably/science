"""Cut 2's selected arms, paired with the sabotage each must not survive.

Same doctrine as `n2_arms.py` (N2: every oracle row can fail), extended over
cut 2's selected rows. The deferred rows' doctrine stays exactly as cut 1 left
it — nothing here touches `ARMS`, and nothing here claims a row cut 2 defers.

Every `before` string below was reconciled against the merged tree at
declaration time, not against the planning brief's sketch of the code (the
brief itself warns the two drift). Where the brief's table names a sabotage
that turned out to be inert against the real code and its real tests — every
candidate anchor and every candidate check tried — the row is still covered
here through an adjacent sabotage with the same semantic effect, and the swap
is recorded in the arm's `asserts` text or the task's report, never silently.
