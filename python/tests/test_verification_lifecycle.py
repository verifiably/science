"""G2c's selected arms: kernel §3.3's lifecycle table walked over values.

"Active" is exercised as *not superseded* only; the standing-retraction clause
of the amended definition is the C group's and is deferred (cut 2 §4.2). A walk
exercising the pre-amendment lifecycle while claiming the amended one is the
over-count that row exists to prevent — so this file claims exactly the
supersession half.
