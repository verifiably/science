"""Cut 1's selected arms, each paired with the sabotage it must not survive.

**N2: every oracle row can fail.** A row that passes under sabotage is itself
defective, and the doctrine is executable law rather than advice — so cut 1's own
rows are not exempt from it. N2's trigger is *the first executable suite*, which
is what this is; a cut whose rows were exempt from the discipline they encode
would be the first thing the corpus should refuse.

Each `Arm` below names three things and nothing else:

* the **row** it belongs to and what that arm asserts, in the banked wording;
* a **sabotage** — a source mutation that makes the asserted property false;
* the **checks** — the exact tests that must fail when it is applied.

Naming the checks is the part that distinguishes this from *"the suite went
red"*. An arm whose sabotage breaks some unrelated test while leaving its own
check green is exactly the defect N2 describes, and a suite-level assertion
cannot see it. Three sessions of hand-run sabotage matrices produced seven
vacuous tests and, twice, a sabotage that had gone stale against code it no
longer matched — which is why staleness is a reported finding here and not a
silent skip.

**Arms are declared, never derived.** A harness that generated sabotages from the
code would assert that the code does what the code does. What an arm asserts
comes from the design; the checks are the reading of it that this suite commits
to.

Cut 2's own selected arms live in `n2_arms_cut2.py`, imported and audited
alongside `ARMS` by `test_n2.py` — this module and its table are cut 1's, held
exactly as cut 1 left them.
