"""M10 — the cross-language parity fixture, Python half.

The fixture is a **frozen conformance oracle**. It is generated once by
`tools/generate_claim_identity_fixture.py`, reviewed, and committed; nothing here
regenerates it, and the generator lives outside the installed package so that
`science` cannot reach it. A fixture recomputed during a test run asserts only
that the implementation agrees with itself, which is the one thing a parity test
must not be satisfied by.

**Every row is built from its components.** The vector carries the claim's parts,
its expected projection, its expected canonical bytes and its expected digest,
and the test walks all four: components → `build_claim` → `project_claim` →
`encode` → `digest`. Comparing the stored projection against the stored bytes
would test `science.identity.v1` parity while bypassing `π_claim` — the shared
encoding covered, the shared projection not, which is most of what M10 is for.

The TypeScript half consumes this same artifact and makes the same four
comparisons. Neither language owns it.

**Declared scope.** The vector cannot exercise `science.identity.v1`'s
code-point-versus-UTF-16 key ordering, because π_claim's only non-fixed keys are
dimension identifiers and the contract grammar restricts those to
`[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` — no contract can issue a key above U+FFFF. That rule is
covered by each language's own `identity.v1` unit tests, and this file does not
claim it.
