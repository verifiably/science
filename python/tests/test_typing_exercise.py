"""Regression tests for the typing exercise's classifiers.

The exercise itself is never run by the suite, for the reason the survey's is
not: it reads corpora outside this repository, so a test asserting a *yield*
would assert something CI cannot see. What is testable is the part that decides
an outcome — whether a record is reported as recording no claim, as carrying a
value the plan does not map, or as refused by the calculus.

Those three are the distinction the whole exercise rests on. A tool that
reported *"the vocabulary is incomplete"* as *"the calculus refused"* would
produce a coverage figure indistinguishable from a real one and wrong in the
direction that flatters the design, and the plan files exist to make the
difference visible rather than to be trusted.
