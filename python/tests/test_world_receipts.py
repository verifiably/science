"""Receipt validation: §7.5's four outcomes, decided in §8.2's order.

**What a receipt claims.** A receipt names a subject identity, the exact
`(rule_identity, implementation_identity)` that produced it, and the exact
captured corpus-state identity of every covered corpus. Validating one is
therefore a rebuild: run *that* implementation over corpora standing at *those*
states and compare the canonical subject projection with the one the epoch
published, byte for byte.

**The four outcomes, and the order they are decided in.** ``malformed`` first
and alone — it is a statement about the receipt document, and §7.5 settles it
before resolvability is ever asked, so no change to what a store holds or where
a corpus stands can move it. ``unresolvable`` second: the named binding is not
held here, or a named corpus does not presently stand at its named state.
``validated`` and ``refuted`` last, and only there, because they are the two
answers a rebuild can give.

**Two layers, and this module lives in the upper one.** The carrier layer
(`test_world_epoch.py`) refuses bytes it cannot read. A receipt that *parses*
and then violates §7.5's contract is not a carrier failure: it opens, reaches
the validator here, and evaluates as ``malformed``. Several arms below build
exactly such a carrier by repackaging a published epoch — recomputing the
packaging identity from the edited members, never asserting a digest literal —
and prove the outcome rather than a refusal.
