"""`decode_claim` — M4, M11, and D3's in-cut arms.

The boundary every import, deserialization and restore comes through. Three
guarantee rows meet here, and they are kept apart deliberately: **M4** is about
referent typing and the receipt, **M11** about the function being a function of
its arguments, and **D3** about the five outcomes staying distinct.

One scope note that a reader will otherwise have to reconstruct. `not-available`
appears in both M4 and D3 and they are **not the same test**. M4's is local — the
vocabulary could not be read — and is in cut 1. D3's is world-level — the dataset
has an address the consulted index records and its corpus is absent — and needs
holding machinery this slice does not build. The cut is explicit that neither
stands in for the other, so only the local one is exercised, and `not-present` is
exercised nowhere.

    It reuses M10's fixture rather than inventing claims, which is the point: the

    a projection. Nothing here re-derives the expected digests; they are the
