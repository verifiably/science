"""G9's selected arms — the upward transition, derived and never stored.

Deferred and deliberately absent here: the "minted as a world entity" clause
(W3's, needs the world boundary), the replay-eligibility third of R5's answer
(run boundary), and the three-check independence sabotage (needs R5 and R10 as
runnable checks). Cut 2 §4.2 records each.
