"""``Claim`` — opacity, the validated constructor, and the authoring boundary.

**M13 in the half that exists.** Its second clause — *"no function downstream of
the boundary accepts a `WireClaim`"* — is **not** tested here, because
`WireClaim` does not exist yet: a scan for it today would pass by finding
nothing, which is a test that cannot fail. It lands with `decodeClaim`.

The profile-dependent refusals below are **M11's**, exercised through the
authoring route because it is the one that exists. M13's scope note is explicit
that sign-aptness, arity, argument sorts, permitted dimensions and admissible
layers are runtime and belong to M11; what is asserted *here* is that they
happen at construction and cannot be bypassed.
