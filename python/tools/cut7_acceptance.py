"""The cut-7 acceptance command — the whole epoch-carrier surface, on the certified tuple.

**It errors off the certified tuple. It never skips.** An environment where
durability cannot be exercised must not be able to report cut-7 discharge, and
a skip is exactly how that happens: the run is green, the count is short, and
nobody reads the count. So the tuple is probed first, once, and a refusal ends
the command with the engine's own words.

Three phases, in order, each one a whole command:

1. `tools/cut5_acceptance.py`, unedited;
2. `tools/cut6_acceptance.py`, unedited; and
3. `tests/acceptance/test_n2_cut7.py` — cut 7's declaration accounting, its N2
   audit, its portable journey, and its durable arms.

Cut 5's and cut 6's runners are historical and are never edited. Cut 7 §5
allows them as a prefix, so they are invoked as they stand and told only *where*
to work; nothing else about them is touched, and their own arguments are not
this command's to pass. Extra arguments reach phase 3's `pytest` and no other.
A prefix that fails stops the command, and the phase banners are what let a
reader attribute a count or a failure to the phase that produced it — the whole
point of a prefix is that its meaning is unchanged, and a run whose three
results are indistinguishable would have lost exactly that.

Usage::

    python tools/cut7_acceptance.py                # every phase
    python tools/cut7_acceptance.py -k journey     # further arguments reach phase 3

The work directory is `<repo>/.cut7-acceptance` unless `SCIENCE_CUT7_ROOT`
names another one — a host whose certified volume is not the one the checkout
lives on sets that. Every phase runs beneath one directory under it, so the
whole command occupies one certified volume and leaves nothing behind.

**Never run beside another acceptance command or the ordinary suite.** All four
cut roots are environment-scoped and two runs would delete each other's roots
mid-transaction, which reads as an engine failure and is not one.
