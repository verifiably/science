"""The cut-4 acceptance command — the durable arms, on the certified tuple.

**It errors off the certified tuple. It never skips.** An environment where
durability cannot be exercised must not be able to report cut-4 discharge, and
a skip is exactly how that happens: the run is green, the count is short, and
nobody reads the count. So the tuple is probed first, once, and a refusal ends
the command with the engine's own words.

Ordinary unit tests are a different command (`pytest`) and a different claim:
plan building, refusal ordering, the intent encoding and facade behaviour
against `DefaultExecutor` run anywhere, and **cannot claim cut-4 discharge**.

Usage::

    python -m tools.cut4_acceptance                # the whole acceptance suite
    python -m tools.cut4_acceptance -k lineage     # further arguments reach pytest

The work directory is `<repo>/.cut4-acceptance` unless `SCIENCE_CUT4_ROOT`
names another one — a host whose certified volume is not the one the checkout
lives on sets that.
