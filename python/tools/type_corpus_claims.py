"""Run `build_claim` over every proposition in a corpus. **Run by hand.**

    uv run python tools/type_corpus_claims.py <plan.yaml> <corpus-dir>

Ledger item 11. The corpus survey established that of 337 structured
propositions across eight proto-science corpora, 307 are mm30's — so the
calculus cannot be validated against the corpus it was fitted to, and the other
two corpora carrying a subject/predicate/object triple use one operator between
them. This tool is the measurement that replaces the disposition record's
hand-typing, whose own §2.1 scope rule said it must: *"the vertical slice must
replace judgment with an executable constructor before any coverage number here
is treated as a property of the system rather than of the exercise."*

Nothing here runs in CI, for the reason the survey gives: the corpora live
outside this repository and change under their own authors. The predicates that
decide an outcome are covered by `tests/test_typing_exercise.py`.

**What is fitted and what is tested** — the distinction this whole exercise
turns on, since a contract authored from a corpus types that corpus by
construction, and a number produced that way measures the author rather than the
calculus.

*Fitted, and therefore not evidence.* The operator names, their `sign_apt`
flags, and their admitted layer sets are read off the corpus's own predicate,
polarity and `claim_layer` fields. A record cannot refuse on any of them,
because the contract was written from them. Arity is fitted twice over: a
subject/object corpus has exactly arity 2 to offer.

*Fitted upstream, which is the harder case to notice.* The predecessor system
enforces the polarity/predicate partition on construction, again in a corpus
check, and again by auto-writing the sign-less value. No corpus can hold a
counterexample, so measuring that partition measures a validator. It is named
here because an earlier version of this file listed it as tested.

*Tested, because the corpus had no say in it.*

1. **Sorts.** `ArgSort(op) : Fin(arity(op)) → Sort` is one sort per slot. mm30's
   terms carry a `<kind>:` prefix but nothing constrains which kinds an operator
   relates, and `affects` is written across all four combinations of its two.
   Refusals here are the calculus meeting a corpus that never sorted.
2. **The layer vocabulary.** A domain *selects* from the base contract's four
   layers and may not extend them (§7.1). A corpus `claim_layer` value with no
   base counterpart has nowhere to go, and no contract edit can give it one.
3. **Whether a claim was recorded at all.** A constructor reads front matter. A
   claim that exists only in a title is not reachable from what the record
   states, and this is where the hand-typed figures and a measured one part.
4. **Whether a qualifier is ever recorded.** No corpus records one, and no plan
   could make it so — `dimensions: {}` throughout is a measured absence.

**Two sortings, both reported.** For a corpus whose terms carry kind prefixes,
one plan declares a single sort covering every term and another declares the
per-slot sorts each operator most often relates. The first measures whether the
rest of the calculus fits once sorts are made vacuous; the second measures what
a sorted vocabulary costs. Reporting either alone would hide the other.

**A plan never defaults.** Every corpus value it cannot map is reported as an
unmapped value against the field it came from, never silently dropped or
coerced. The two failures a typing exercise must not confuse are *the
vocabulary is incomplete* and *the calculus refused*, and a default would
convert the first into the second's absence.

**Stop rule, inherited from the disposition record's §5.5 and unchanged.** No
belief is computed and no persistence boundary is crossed. This tool reads and
prints; it writes nothing.
