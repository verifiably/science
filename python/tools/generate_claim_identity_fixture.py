"""Generate M10's cross-language parity fixture. **Run by hand, never by tests.**

    uv run python tools/generate_claim_identity_fixture.py

The output is a **conformance oracle**, not a source of truth. `science.identity.v1`
and the base contract remain the normative sources; this file is what two
implementations compare against so that a divergence is caught as a divergence
rather than each side confirming its own arithmetic. Python bootstraps the bytes
because something has to; the artifact is then **reviewed and frozen**, and the
test suite only ever reads it. A fixture regenerated during a test run asserts
that the implementation agrees with itself.

Two decisions the reader should not have to reverse-engineer.

**The vector carries components, not just an expected projection.** Each row
holds the claim's parts, and both implementations must **build and project from
the parts**. A fixture whose only input were the projection would test
`science.identity.v1` parity while bypassing `π_claim` entirely — the shared
encoding would be covered and the shared *projection* would not, which is most of
what M10 is for.

**The file is written pure-ASCII** (`ensure_ascii=True`). The vector deliberately
contains non-ASCII and combining-character referents, and an editor, a merge tool
or a copy-paste that normalized them would silently change what the fixture
asserts — which is exactly the class of bug it exists to catch. Escaped, the
bytes on disk cannot drift, and both languages' JSON parsers decode them
identically.
