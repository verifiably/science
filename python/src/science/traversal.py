"""One algorithm, two adjacency adapters (substrate consolidation design §3).

The traversal `nodes` withdrew lives here, above its one-hop `outbound()` /
`inbound()` operations. It serves two callers whose *edges* have nothing in
common — a `supersedes` step is a stored `Relation` with a predicate and a
`directed` flag; a lineage step is a **facet** with neither — so the sharing
stops at the walk itself. What is shared is behaviour: **cycle-safe,
start-excluding, skip-and-report, sorted**, certified once because one function
performs both closures.

**The result is structured, and a bare list of reached ids could not satisfy
this contract.** The algorithm promises to *report* a step whose target does not
resolve, and the lineage caller must tell an absent **ancestor** from an absent
**producing run**. Neither survives a return type carrying only what resolved,
and for a facet-valued step there is no second source of truth to recover it
from — `nodes`' own `dangling()` is relations-only and cannot see one.

**Every unresolved entry says where it was stored.** A relation entry carries
the source node's live id and the position of the relation in that node's
stored list; without those, `X ─cites→ M` and `Y ─cites→ M` produce one
identical entry, two defects deduplicate into one, and the ordering has no
tie-break. A lineage entry carries the dataset, the route, and which position in
the route failed.

**Start-excluding.** The start never appears in `reached`, a cycle back to it
included. Callers that need it say so — substrate §5's inspected set is
`{observed root} ∪ closure`, the union written out, because deleting the root's
own immediate parent must still be seen.
