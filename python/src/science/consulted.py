"""The consulted-contract set — computed, never supplied (cut 2 §3).

A digest over a supplied consulted set cannot fail when a contract that should
have entered it was withheld, and an arm that cannot fail is malformed under
N2. So membership is walked here: the base contract unconditionally, each
domain contract only if the derivation actually read something it declares —
which in this slice means the claim schema: the proposition's operator, whose
compiled declaration carries the namespace that declared it (formal model ρA6:
a facet-only walk would miss exactly this). Resolution runs against supplied
per-corpus pins; §8.1's agreement rule refuses a closure whose corpora disagree.
