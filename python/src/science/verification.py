"""Verification as a value, and the derived lifecycle (kernel §3.3).

Consumed, never produced: no replay happens here, and the node is an argument.
The assessment has no verification field — its state is derived from the
verifications pointing at it, by the fail-closed table below, every time it is
asked. Only `(clean-environment, passed)` admits; the final row is a complement
so the table is total by construction.

"Active" here means **not superseded by a later verification that explicitly
references it**. The amended definition (correction-lifecycle §7a) also excludes
targets of a standing retraction; that clause needs retraction records and is
deferred with the C group — cut 2 §4.2 records the split, and this docstring is
the claim's stated bound.
