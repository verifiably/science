"""Lineage snapshot values and independence certification (substrate §5, S5).

Consumes a **supplied** snapshot only. The walk that *produces* a snapshot from
a store — resolving refs against `nodes`, following the boundary-minted basis
across a live corpus — is S1a's and the write API's, and stays out of this
module by cut 2 §4.2. What lives here is the pure computation substrate §5
specifies once a snapshot is in hand: the tagged basis, the divergence test,
and the certification procedure over it.

**Orientation and the basis.** `derived_from` is a *view* over a run's
`produces ∘ transforms`, not a stored edge, so what is durable is the
**lineage basis** stamped on the descendant: a producing-run ref and its
resolved ancestor, tagged `single(route)` when the boundary minted it, or
`conflict([route, ...])` — at least two, sorted — when two records at one
content address disagree. `Basis` enforces the tagging at construction: a
`single` holding more than one route, or a `conflict` holding fewer than two
distinct sorted routes, is refused (`MalformedSnapshot`) so that a conflict
that never occurred cannot be spelled (one representation per fact).

**Certification (substrate §5's procedure, condensed to the supplied-snapshot
form).** For each side's roots: the inspected set is `{root} ∪ closure`,
walked through basis routes' resolved ancestors — start-excluding traversal
plus the explicit root, because deleting the root's own immediate parent must
still be seen (§5 step 1). Then, in order: any `conflict` basis in the
inspected set decides `lineage-divergent` on the **tag alone**, before any
resolution or comparison (§5 step 2, short-circuit); any unresolved basis
entry — either resolution `None` — or a cycle decides `lineage-incomplete`
(§5 step 2b); any `single` basis whose producer set holds a `transforms`
divergence from the route decides `lineage-divergent` (§5 step 3, and *only*
against `single` — a conflict has no one route to diverge from, already
decided). Only complete, undiverged, **disjoint** closures certify
`independent`; complete, undiverged, overlapping closures certify
`shared-source`; anything else is `not-certified` — never a synonym for
`shared-source`, which asserts *demonstrated* common ancestry.

**The projection (kernel §5.1).** `snapshot_projection` renders the snapshot
as content the identity contract can digest: roots, basis tuples with the tag
inside, producer sets, and derived divergence states. Every stored ref and its
resolution are recorded **separately** — `{"stored": ref, "resolved": [] |
[uid]}` — because that pair is what makes a deletion visible in the digest:
the stored ref is unchanged, the resolution flips to the empty list, and the
digest moves. Recording either half alone loses the deletion. The identity
contract refuses `None`, so the unresolved half is spelled as an empty list,
never a null.
