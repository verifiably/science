"""``ProfileSpec`` — the sole compiled runtime profile.

D §6 closed substrate §12 by **retiring** the second per-kind source of truth
rather than picking a winner between two. One normative source — the `science`
base contract together with the activated domain contracts — and every runtime
artifact compiled from it:

    base contract  ─┐   (normative SSOT)
                    ├─▶  ProfileSpec  ─┬─▶  KindSpec set  (D4, deferred)
    domain contracts┘   (compiled)     └─▶  claim schemas (M7, here)

Only the claim-schema half is built. `KindSpec` compilation is **D4**, fully
deferred from cut 1, and an operator roster is not a per-kind artifact — an
operator belongs to no kind, which is why D §6 had to be widened rather than
merely read (M7).

**`ProfileSpec` resolves; contracts authorize** (§7.5). The two roles must not
blur, and the sharp consequence is that **`ProfileSpec`'s own identity never
appears in `π_claim` or in the consulted set**. If a compiled artifact were an
identity authority, recompiling — a different merge order, a different compiler —
could move claim identity with no contract edit anywhere, which is
`KIND_DESCRIPTORS`' defect one level up. What enters `belief_input_digest` is the
set of **contract** identities (D6), never the compiled artifact's.

``compiled_identity`` exists for a narrower job: it is what M7 means by
*"semantic-schema edits recompile, description edits do not."* It is derived from
the merged **schema projections** alone, so an editorial edit moves the contract
identity and leaves this one still. It is not an input to any claim.
