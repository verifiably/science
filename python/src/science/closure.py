"""The belief input closure and its digest (kernel §5.1, G3, P3).

**"A member is in the closure because something reads it"** (kernel §5.1) —
never because it is the tidiest description of the lineage. The projection
below is exactly `science.belief.v1`'s reads, and nothing else: a candidate
member that no evaluation step consults does not belong here, and a member
the evaluation reads but this projection omits is a digest that cannot move
when that read's answer does (G3).

**Membership is computed from what the caller supplies as records, not
enumerated by the caller** (cut 2 §3): the `assessment_facets`,
`propositions`, `verifications` and `observes` members are built by filtering
`assessments`, `runs` and `verifications` down to `proposition` — never
handed in pre-filtered, so a record that should have entered cannot be
withheld by a caller's omission and still leave a passing digest (the N2
concern this closure exists to close). The remaining members — the lineage
snapshot's projection, the producer-snapshot identity, the retraction
enumeration, the policy binding, the consulted-contract pairs — are supplied
as already-computed values: this module digests them, it does not compute
them (the consulted walk is task 6's, independence certification is task 8's).

Source assertions have no parameter here at all. Nothing filters, projects or
digests a `SourceAssertion` — that absence is G1's digest half, and the N2
sabotage that reintroduces one is what it must be caught by.

Heldness is **not** a member: it selects the shape of the evaluator's answer
(whether a `held`-eligible input is even available to weigh), never the
answer's value, so it has nothing here to be a read of (G3's arm restriction,
ρA8).

`binding` is a plain `(rule identity, implementation identity)` pair, not
`PolicyBinding` — that type arrives in task 8. This module digests the pair;
the evaluator owns the type and passes `(binding.rule, binding.implementation)`.
