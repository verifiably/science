"""The stored shape of a Science record — facet keys, relation predicates, and
the semantic hash over them.

Cuts 1–3 built the **values**: assessments, runs, datasets, verifications,
declarations. This module is the one place that says how such a value sits in a
`nodes` document, and how it is read back out of one. Two readers of the same
store disagreeing about which facet carries a run's spec is a corpus with two
meanings, so the mapping is code in one module rather than convention repeated
at each call site.

**Facet keys are unnamespaced.** They belong to the `science` base profile, not
to a domain contract (domain-extension boundary §3.4), and `empirical-observation`
is the one the eligibility predicate turns on.

**Relation predicates are kernel §4.1's closed signatures**, and the role-typed
inputs are stored as relations rather than as facet payload: they are edges the
substrate already resolves, and duplicating them inside a facet would create a
second answer to *what did this run observe*.

Two positions genuinely carry the same ref twice, and it is worth saying why
rather than tidying it away. An assessment's `assesses` and `produced_by` edges
are what the substrate resolves and what kernel §4.1 makes the guarantee out of;
its facet's `proposition` and `run` fields are what `(spec, run, proposition)`
digests. The builders below write both from one argument, so nothing this slice
mints can disagree with itself; a raw write that makes them disagree is an
untrusted import, subject to the same stated bound as every other one.

**The semantic hash covers a fixed set of facets per kind, named in code.** A
stored `covers` list would be data an untrusted writer could shorten, which is a
hash that certifies whatever it was pointed at. What is stored is the digest
alone; the coverage is `COVERED_FACETS`, and the projection records which
covered facets are **present**, so adding a governed facet to a stored node
without restamping is a disagreement rather than a silent extension.

**A governed kind must carry a stamp; a prose kind never has to** *(post-freeze
strengthening, adapter design review 2026-08-18)*. `SEMANTIC_DOMAINS` already
partitions the corpus: a kind with a semantic domain is minted stamped by the
boundary without exception, so an unstamped stored record of such a kind is a
raw write that skipped even self-stamping — statically detectable, and refused
(`semantic-hash-missing`) rather than admitted as the cheapest forgery. Kinds
with no semantic domain — every hand-authored prose node — carry no stamp
obligation. The recorded-history bound (substrate §4.2.1) is unchanged and
covers exactly what it says: fields and stamp moved *together* are undetectable.
