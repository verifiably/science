"""Domain contracts — operators, dimensions and sorts.

§7.1: **operators are domain-issued without exception**, and the base contract
may not issue one. A domain-neutral relation like ``subtype-of`` belongs to a
general-purpose domain contract, since nothing requires a "domain" to be a
natural science.

Two identities, deliberately different in kind (§7.3):

    term identifier     authored, stable, namespaced      enters claim identity
    contract identity   content-derived, moves on edit    enters belief_input_digest

Succession (§8.3) is the *never redefine* rule made checkable. It compares the
**canonical schema projection** — the meaning-bearing fields — so an editorial
edit is free while an `arity` change is refused at load. Two fields are
deliberately outside that projection:

* ``description``, which is editorial by definition; and
* ``retired``, because retirement is a status change and putting it in the
  projection would make **retiring** an identifier a redefinition of it, which
  is precisely the operation §7.3a requires to be permitted.
