"""The read surface over a published epoch: opening one, and answering from it.

Specification §8.1 gives a world two ways to name a publication and only two.
`open_epoch` names one **explicitly**, by the packaging identity of the bytes
it means. `current_epoch` follows the operational pointer and then performs the
same open — no weaker validation, no different result type, no separate path
into the carrier.

**`current` is operational convenience and nothing else.** It exists so a human
or a script can say "the one this world last published" without carrying a
digest around. It is not a belief input and it is not an identity: an API that
accepts belief inputs accepts an explicit producer-snapshot identity, never the
word or the function `current` (§8.1). Nothing in this module is reachable from
belief, and the reason is structural rather than a convention — a snapshot is
retrieved by its own identity from whichever retained epoch carries it.

**One lock, taken before the recovery barrier.** Every act here acquires
`_WorldState.lock` first and crosses the recovery barrier second. Opening an
epoch holds it through the whole carrier read, because publication holds the
same lock across its whole transaction and a reader arriving mid-publication
must wait and then see the finished epoch rather than mistake an applied prefix
for a malformed carrier. The lock is not reentrant, which is why
`current_epoch` reaches `epoch._locked_open_epoch` directly rather than calling
`open_epoch` — re-entry would not be a style question here, it would deadlock.
Every `_locked_*` helper below obeys the same rule: the caller holds the lock
and the helper never re-takes it.

**What the lock does not cover is as deliberate.** Receipt validation takes it
for the recovery barrier and the rules-store resolution — a read of the store
that rule removal writes to under the same lock — and releases it before a
single corpus is opened. The corpus reads and the rule run that follow are
exactly the work `build_epoch` keeps outside its own critical section, and the
exclusion they need is per corpus and is taken per corpus. Holding the world
lock across them would put every registry append and every rule install behind
one enumeration of every covered corpus, on every coreference edge query.

**Receipt validation is the upper of §8.2's two layers.** The carrier layer
refuses bytes it cannot read; this layer judges whether a receipt that *did*
read honours §7.5's contract. The two never merge. `validate_receipt` may not
recover a contract fault by catching `EpochMalformed` — the prohibition is
written into `epoch._parse_receipt`'s docstring — and it reads a receipt
through `_ReceiptCarrier.document`, the deep-frozen whole document from the one
parse the open already performed, rather than going back to the bytes.

**The order the four outcomes are decided in is the contract, not an
optimisation.** `malformed` is settled from the document alone, before this
module has consulted a rules store or looked at a corpus, because §7.5 puts an
unsound receipt contract ahead of resolvability: a receipt naming no exact
implementation cannot be made resolvable by installing one, so asking
availability first and overriding the answer later would be reaching the right
verdict by the wrong route — and the wrong route is observable the moment two
faults coexist. Only once the contract holds does availability decide
`unresolvable`; only once availability holds does the rebuild decide between
`validated` and `refuted`.

**Every answer is bound, and the binding is a shape.** §8.3's `BoundStamp`
carries the epoch's packaging identity and its complete coverage declaration,
and every answer type takes one as a required constructor argument, so an
unstamped answer is unconstructible rather than merely unproduced. The stamp
means "from this publication over this declared coverage" and nothing else:
nothing here measures what has changed since capture, and nothing here may
imply that nothing has.

**The result unions are four small frozen dataclasses.** Not a generic result
framework, and not one type with a discriminant field. §8.3 closes the
resolution union at three arms and §8.4 closes the edge state at three values;
a framework would make both open again, and a caller would have to read a
runtime tag where a type match says the same thing statically.

**Why this is a module and not more of `epoch.py`.** Specification §3 pins the
world package's layout, and the two halves it separates are the carrier — what
an epoch *is*, how it is derived and how it is published — and the reads a
world performs *through* one.

) -> derive.ReceiptOutcome:
    """§7.5's verdict on one receipt of one opened epoch.

    Three phases, and the order between them is the contract.

    **Well-formedness**, from the document alone. The keys are exactly
    `epoch.RECEIPT_KEYS[member]`, the discriminant is
    `epoch.RECEIPT_KINDS[member]`, every identity member is written and is a
    well-formed identity, the corpus states are sorted and name each corpus
    once, and a receipt carrying its subject's projection carries the
    projection its subject identity digests. Any failure is ``malformed`` and
    the act returns *before* the world lock is taken — an unsound contract is
    not something a store or a corpus can repair.

    **Availability.** The exact `(rule_identity, implementation_identity)` pair
    must be held here, with its fixtures run — that resolution takes the world
    lock, because it is a read of the rules store and rule removal writes to it
    under the same lock. Every named corpus must then presently stand at the
    exact state the receipt named, which is a read of each corpus under each
    corpus's own hold. Either failing is ``unresolvable``: nothing was rebuilt,
    so nothing was contradicted. A configured root claiming a manifest this
    world cannot read is ``unresolvable`` too — the named state cannot be
    reached — rather than an exception, because §8.4 makes an edge whose
    receipt is anything but ``validated`` ``indeterminate``, and a query that
    raised instead would have no answer to give.

    **The rebuild.** The exact held implementation runs over the corpora as
    re-read, and the canonical §7.6 projection it produces is compared byte for
    byte with the one this epoch published — the member for the two subjects
    §6.1 stores as members, the receipt's own carried projection for the two
    §7.5 stores inside receipts — and the subject identity is recomputed over
    it. Agreement is ``validated``; an omission, a wrong reduction, or a
    subject identity naming something else is ``refuted``.

    **The world lock is released before any corpus is opened**, and the rebuild
    runs outside it. `build_epoch` states the principle for the identical work:
    derivation happens before the lock is reacquired, "so nothing that could
    refuse or take time happens inside the critical section". A validation that
    held the world lock across an enumeration of every covered corpus and a run
    of loaded rule code would serialize every registry append and every rule
    install in the world behind one query — and every coreference edge query
    performs exactly that validation. The exclusion validation actually needs
    is per corpus, and `_standing` takes it per corpus.

    A receipt that reached here at all has already passed the carrier layer.
    This never catches `EpochMalformed` to recover a contract fault, and never
    re-reads the member bytes: `_ReceiptCarrier.document` is the one parse.
