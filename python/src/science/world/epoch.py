"""The epoch carrier: its frozen member inventory and the receipts inside it.

A world publishes an **epoch** — a content-addressed directory holding four
derived maps, the producer snapshot, four derivation receipts, and the two
declarations that bound them — at ``epochs/<packaging_identity>/``. Slice 2's
specification §6.1 fixes that layout exactly, and `EPOCH_MEMBERS` below is that
inventory. Nothing else writes beneath ``epochs/`` except the one-line
``current`` pointer, which is a member of the *directory* ``epochs/`` and never
of an epoch.

**Two things live here, and they meet only at the draft.** The first is the
part the rules store needs: **which receipts a retained epoch carries, and
which exact rule binding each one names.** A receipt is what makes a derived
map re-checkable, so it records the exact
``(rule_identity, implementation_identity)`` that produced its subject (§7.5).
That makes the epochs directory the place — the only place — where a world can
answer "what evidence would I strand if I stopped holding this pair?", which is
what `science.world.rules.remove_rule_binding` must report.

The second is a build's **coherent preflight and capture** (§5.2, §5.3) and the
**publication** that follows it (§5.4, §6.3), in the bottom half of this
module: the acts that read live state, the frozen `_BuildDraft` that separates
them from everything pure, and the one transaction that turns derived bytes
into a retained epoch. They are here rather than beside the derivations because
an epoch is what they are gathering the inputs for, and because the draft's
shape — anchors, coverage, captured states, the build-start world head — is
§6.1's layout read backwards.

A receipt identity is the digest under `RECEIPT_DOMAIN` of the canonical
projection ``(receipt kind, subject projection identity, sorted corpus-state
pairs, rule identity, implementation identity)``. The kind discriminant is what
keeps the four receipt subjects disjoint under one domain. It is carried
*inside* the document as well as implied by the member name, and the identity
digests the document's own value: a document whose discriminant disagrees with
the member holding it still has one identity, and which of the two readings is
wrong is the validator's finding to make.

**Two layers, and this module is the lower one** (§8.2). Reading a receipt out
of a carrier and judging whether that receipt honours its contract are separate
questions with separate outcomes. What refuses here is *structural
unreadability*: bytes that are not a YAML mapping, a duplicate key, or a value
that is present and is not the text the identity formula digests. Everything a
reader can still lift *something* out of is handed on intact — a discriminant
disagreeing with its member, a value that is not an identity, an unsorted or
repeated corpus state, a key outside the kind's declared set, and an identity
member the document simply omits. Those are receipt-contract violations, and
§8.2's carrier list is closed and names none of them: it is "invalid YAML, a
missing or extra epoch **member**, a bad member content name, or a
packaging-identity mismatch", where a member is one of the eleven files. A
missing receipt *key* is §7.5's own closing sentence instead — "An unsound
receipt contract is ``malformed``" — and turning one into a carrier failure
would close the path §8.2 exists to keep open, where a malformed coreference
receipt opens, evaluates as ``malformed``, and leaves its edges
``indeterminate``.

An omitted identity member is therefore read as *absent*, not as a refusal:
`_ReceiptCarrier` holds each of the five as optional and `missing` names the
ones the document did not carry, which is exactly the finding the validator
has to report. Such a receipt has no identity — there is nothing to digest —
and it names no binding, which is the honest answer rather than a convenient
one: §7.5 puts an unsound contract at ``malformed`` before resolvability is
ever asked, so no act that changes what a store *holds* can move its outcome.

`RECEIPT_KEYS` therefore *declares* the closed per-kind contract without
enforcing it: the receipt validator is what enforces it. The two
projection-bearing kinds carry more than the identity members — §7.5 puts the
retraction enumeration projection inside the retraction receipt and the
certification inventory inside the certification receipt — so one closed set
across all four kinds would be wrong in both directions at once.

**Two readings of a carrier, and the weaker one is deliberate.** The sever scan
answers "which receipts does this world retain", and it stops at the member
set: it recomputes no digest and no packaging identity, because §4.3's removal
report is about the receipts a carrier holds, not about the name the directory
holding them was given, and a stricter scan would make one damaged epoch block
every removal in its world. `_locked_open_epoch` is the strong reading, and it
is what every *read* of an epoch goes through: the exact member set, every
closed document, and the recomputed packaging identity.

**Deliberately not here yet.** Selecting `current` and reading through an epoch
belong to `science.world.read`; deleting one is later still. Nothing beneath
``epochs/`` is written by any act but the one publication transaction below.

**Layering.** The *carrier* half knows nothing of the rules store: a receipt
names a binding as two digests, and reading a receipt does not require holding
what it names. The build half does need the store — preflight resolves four
exact pairs and runs their fixtures — and reaches it through
`science.world.rules` at call time, which is also what keeps the import cycle
between the two modules resolvable in every order.

    — a route-arm target names an embedded route, not a record — and the target
    ref is resolved through the corpus index here, exactly as the corpus-local
    judgement resolves it, so a retraction naming another by a deprecated id
    still overturns it. `_acyclic_postorder` is the corpus's own traversal,
    reused rather than reimplemented: a retraction cycle is
    `RetractionCycleMalformed` here for the same reason it is there.

    **What this deliberately does not do, and the divergence it creates.**
    `standing_in_local_view` first puts every retraction through

    eligibility, exact resolution and a matching target content identity, and
    raises `RetractionTargetIneligible` / `RetractionTargetUnresolvable` when
    any of it fails. This does none of that. So on a corpus whose retraction
    target has drifted, the corpus *declines to judge* while capture records
    `upheld` or `overturned` — and that resolution reaches the retraction
    enumeration projection and its published identity.

    subclasses: they are the admission gate's verdict on an *act*, not a
    finding about stored content, and re-running them here would make an epoch
    build a second, later admission gate over records the corpus already holds
    — one raw-imported retraction anywhere in any covered corpus would then
    make the whole world unbuildable. §5.3 closes capture's refusal surface at
    `EnumeratedKindUngoverned` and `CaptureDrift` and names no target-validity
    requirement, and the resolution a capture publishes is a claim about the
    retraction graph ("nothing standing in this corpus retracts this
    retraction"), never a claim that the retraction's own target still
    resolves. A reader checks that through the epoch's address map and the

    """Delete one whole retained epoch, and report what it severed (§9).

    Explicit consumer policy. Nothing in this package calls it, no schedule
    triggers it, and there is no act that deletes one member of an epoch: an
    epoch is published whole and it is removed whole.

    Under one acquisition of the world lock, and in this order: cross the
    recovery barrier, read and validate `current`, refuse `EpochCurrent` for
    the epoch the pointer names, then open the target. `current` is checked
    before the target is opened because "you may not delete this one" is an
    answer about the world's state rather than about the target's bytes, and a
    consumer who asked to delete the current epoch is owed that answer even if
    the carrier underneath it is also damaged.

    Every *other* retained epoch is then opened with the same private locked
    loader, because the report's question — is this identity still carried
    here? — is a question about what those epochs hold, and §8.1's carrier rule
    is that an epoch this world cannot read refuses the act that reads it. A
    damaged epoch elsewhere therefore refuses the whole deletion with
    `EpochMalformed`, exactly as a damaged carrier refuses a rule removal: a
    sever report computed over a scan that quietly skipped one would be the
    silent unresolvability §4.3 refuses to produce.

    One transaction, holding a `DeleteOp` for each of the eleven members. The
    emptied directory stays where it is; §9 calls it nonsemantic and `_emptied`
    is what makes that true rather than merely stated. There is no tombstone:
    a repeated call raises `EpochUnknown`, and slice 2 claims no exact retry
    after commit.
