"""Pure derivation: one captured view, four subjects, and one receipt contract.

Specification §7.1 splits an epoch build in two. **Capture** enumerates each
covered corpus exactly once, under that corpus's operation lock, and produces
an immutable captured view. **Derivation** — everything in this module — reads
that view and nothing else. It cannot inspect a corpus root, a registry, a
`current` pointer or an installed default, because it is handed none of them
and imports nothing that could find one. That is the property receipts rest on:
a receipt names the exact captured states it ran over, and a derivation that
could quietly consult a live corpus would make the states it names a partial
account of what it read.

**One captured-record model** (`Capture`, `CapturedCorpus`, `CapturedRecord`).
Not four. §7.1 says the pass produces a view *sufficient for all four
derivations*, so the four reducers read one projection of one model rather than
four bespoke pre-flattened inputs. A record carries the members every
derivation shares — its address, its `uid`, its declared kind, its
`deprecated_ids` and its `produces` edges — and composes in the at-most-one
facet value its kind contributes: a captured retraction, a captured
certification, or a captured coreference attestation. A record's facet slots
are `None` where the record has nothing to say, never absent, so a reducer
reads a total shape and no reducer needs a default.

**Where each derivation lives, and why they are not all rules.** §5.2's build
input names one exact `(rule_identity, implementation_identity)` pair for each
of *four* derivations, and §7.5 mints one receipt for each: the producer
snapshot, the retraction enumeration, the certification inventory and the
coreference map. Those four are fixture-bound rules, held in the rules store,
and this module only parses what they return and computes the pinned identity
of it. The address map (§7.2) and the retraction-discovery map (§7.4) are the
epoch's other two derived maps; neither is a receipt subject, so neither is a
rule, and both are plain folds over the same captured view here. Each fold
reads the captured records — never a corpus — so "one enumeration pass" is
preserved: what is not repeated is the *enumeration*, not the arithmetic.

**Parsing a rule's return is not ceremony.** A rule is admitted content, and
`science.identity.v1` would happily digest a return of the wrong shape into a
perfectly stable identity for a projection §7.6 does not describe. So each
subject value parses the return — closed key set, sorted, distinct, typed —
and re-emits §7.6's projection itself. `RuleNonconformant` is the refusal, the
same name the store uses when an implementation fails its fixtures, because it
is the same fault found one moment later.

**Reading these projections beside §7.6.** The specification writes each
projection with an explicit `list(sorted(...))`; `sorted` already returns a
list, so the code below writes `sorted(...)` and the encoded bytes are the
same. Nothing else about the four projections differs from the text.

**Identity domains, pinned here.** `science.producer-snapshot.v1`,
`science.retraction-enumeration.v1`, `science.certification-inventory.v1` and
`science.coreference-map.v1` are §7.6's four, minted by that amendment. The
receipt domain is `epoch.RECEIPT_DOMAIN`, and a receipt digests the *subject
projection identity* — never the subject bytes a second time.

**One belief input.** The producer snapshot identity is the only member of an
epoch that reaches belief (§7.3). The coreference map is outside belief by the
world-address ruling §5.3, so its receipt carries no semantic identity — and
because the four receipts share one contract, the absence has to be a property
of the receipt's field set rather than a rule about one kind. `DerivationReceipt`
therefore has nowhere to put a semantic identity or a belief member at all;
`BELIEF_INPUT_KIND` names the one kind whose *subject* is one.
