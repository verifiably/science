"""The fixture-bound rules store: a world holds a rule, verifies it, and runs it.

A derivation receipt names the exact rule that produced its map, so the world
has to be able to *hold* that rule — store its normative fixtures, store one or
more conforming implementations of it, and prove at any later moment that the
implementation it is about to run is still the one the receipt names. Slice 2's
specification §4 pins the two identities that make this possible, and both
domain strings are minted here:

* a **fixture-set identity** is `science.fixture-set.v1` over the sorted
  `(member name, member content digest)` pairs; and
* a **rule identity** is `science.enumeration-rule.v1` over
  `(symbol, fixture-set identity)`.

A **member content digest** is the 64-character lowercase SHA-256 hex digest of
that member's exact bytes, and an implementation's content identity is the same
digest over its source. A runnable binding is therefore the exact pair
`(rule_identity, implementation_identity)`, stored as::

    rules/<rule_identity>/rule.yaml
    rules/<rule_identity>/fixtures/<fixture members>
    rules/<rule_identity>/implementations/<implementation_identity>

The layout keeps the normative half — the symbol and its fixtures — shared, and
several conforming implementations of one rule beside each other without
pretending they are one implementation. Nothing here selects among them: a
receipt resolves the exact pair it names, never "the implementation this
installation would choose today". There is deliberately no registry, no entry
point, and no installed default to consult.

**The loader is a trusted-code admission boundary, not a sandbox.** An
implementation is executable content, and executing it is exactly what holding
it means. What this module guarantees is *which* bytes run: an explicit install
act admitted them, their digest names them, and the normative fixtures pass
against them at admission and again at every resolution. It is not a security
boundary and does not pretend to be one. The rule ABI is correspondingly small:
the entry point receives one immutable projection value and returns one
projection value. No world, corpus, path or executor is reachable from it.
