"""Coreference reduction — sorted endpoint pair to balance and distinct count.

The subject projection is specification §7.6's coreference map. The reduction
is the world-address ruling §5.2's: a unit is a distinct
`(endpoints, stance, actor, grounds)`, the event token is deliberately outside
that key, and every unit carries weight ±1 regardless of who submitted it. So
exact duplicates — a retry, a re-import, a second submission of the same stance
on the same grounds — do not add weight, while one attester's genuinely
different grounds do.

The reduction stores no edge state. Whether an edge is active is a function of
the querying world and of whether the receipt resolves now, neither of which an
immutable epoch can know.
