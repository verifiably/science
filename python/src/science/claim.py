"""``Claim`` — the typed claim, and the only route to one.

```text
Claim  =  Σ (op : Operator).  Args(op) × Qualifiers(op) × Polarity(op) × Layer(op)
```

§6.2's dependent sum, as far as a language without a code-generation layer can
carry it. Choosing the operator determines the *types* of everything else, and
the operators arrive through a runtime-loaded `ProfileSpec` — so neither Python
nor TypeScript can vary this constructor's static signature by them. §6.3 says
exactly what survives that, and **M13 is scoped to it**: `Claim` is opaque, its
only route is the validated constructor, and the profile-dependent checks
therefore happen **once**, at one place, after which no downstream reader
re-validates.

What is *not* claimed here: that an ill-typed claim is unspellable. It is
refused, not unconstructible, and the refusals below are ordinary runtime
refusals. Writing that a Python dataclass makes wrong-sorted arguments
unspellable would be the slogan §6.2 warns against, one layer down.

**Retirement is enforced on the authoring route and nowhere else** (§7.3a).
`build_claim` refuses a withdrawn operator or dimension; `Claim._checked` does
not, because decode, import and restore type a *historical* claim against the
frozen declaration and refusing there would corrupt the history retirement
exists to preserve. The two routes share every profile-dependent check and
differ in exactly that one respect.

**Referent membership is not checked here.** Whether an argument's term is in
its sort's bound vocabulary depends on the `ResolutionSnapshot` (§7.2) — a
parameter this module does not take, since a check whose result varies with what
happens to be readable cannot be a property of the value. That is M4's, and it
arrives with `decodeClaim`. Until it does, `build_claim` types a claim's shape
against the profile and says nothing about whether its referents exist.

    §6.2 types an argument slot as `Referent(ArgSort(op, i))`, and `Referent(gene)`

    the other. What that becomes at runtime is that the sort travels *with* the
    value: a bare string cannot occupy a slot at all (M4), because a string
    carries no sort and so there is nothing to compare against the slot.

    Freely constructible: the opacity M13 requires is `Claim`'s, and a `Referent`
    is an ordinary typed value that a check *admits* rather than trusts. But it
    owns its own field invariant, because **`term` is the one position in a claim
    that nothing downstream checks**. The operator, the layer, the dimensions and
    the sorts are all matched against the profile's tables, so a non-identifier
    in any of them refuses on its own; a referent's term is checked only for
    *membership*, and that is deferred to decode against a snapshot. Without the
