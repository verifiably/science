"""``science.identity.v1`` — the canonical value contract.

Specified by the computation-reproducibility design §4.3. The requirement is not
strictness but **injectivity**: a value's type must survive its encoding. §4.3
records four collisions that had to be closed and notes that two of them were
introduced by the fixes for the other two, which is why each rule below is
stated as an encoding that preserves type rather than value.

Six kinds depend on this (world §4.2 assigns content-derived bases to
``dataset``, ``analysis-spec``, ``run``, ``verification``, ``assessment`` and
``source-assertion`` and specifies canonicalization for none of them), and the
formal model adds a seventh position: ``I_claim`` is this encoding under the
``tag_claim`` domain.

Two rules below are **not** in §4.3, which says "canonical JSON" without pinning
what that means. Both are recorded as amendments in the design; they are noted
here because a reader comparing the code to §4.3 will not find them there:

* **String escaping is pinned exactly** (``_encode_string``). "Canonical JSON"
  does not determine it — Python and JavaScript disagree by default on non-ASCII
  and on control characters — and an unpinned escape rule is a silent
  cross-language identity fork.
* **Object keys sort by code point, never by UTF-16 code unit.** These orders
  differ above U+FFFF, and JavaScript's default sort uses the wrong one.
