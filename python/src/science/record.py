"""Run, assessment and source-assertion values for the belief seam.

Runs here are **values with role-typed inputs, not the execution boundary** —
begin/capture/replay is not built, `spec` is an opaque supplied identity, and
every R row stays at the run boundary (cut 2 §3). The roles are kernel §4.1's:
`observes` is what confers eligibility, `reads` never does in any quantity (G6),
`transforms` is dataset-production lineage input.

The assessment facet is kernel §4.2.1's table, with `estimand` and
`applicability` deliberately untyped prose (belief-policy §3.2 — typing them is
ρO3's open neighbourhood, not this module's to claim). Its identity is
`(spec, run, proposition)`; its keyed facet digest is what the closure pairs
with that identity (kernel §5.1's first member).
