"""Datasets: the declaration, the §6.2 basis projection, and the derived state.

The admission ramp's ruling (2026-08-09 §6), executable. Three states decided in
order — basis first, then holding — and the state is **derived, never stored**:
nothing here has a state field, `admission_state` recomputes from a declaration
and the byte observations *supplied to the call*, and no API accepts an authored
`held` (G9).

Where a verified observation is *recorded* is the ramp's §8 item 2 and is
undesigned; an argument's type is not a storage design (cut 2 §2.1). That is why
`ByteObservation` is two fields and no timestamp: §8 item 1 (probe-evidence
lifetime) is open, a supplied observation's currency is the caller's assertion,
and a field would invite reading it.
