"""`decode_claim` — the boundary M₀ never stated.

```text
decodeClaim :  WireClaim × ProfileSpec × ResolutionSnapshot
               ──▶  (Claim × BindingCheckReceipt) + Refused
```

**Unconstructibility eliminates the internal guard; it does not eliminate the
boundary** (§6.3). Serialized YAML, an imported record, a restored corpus and a
raw write can all *express* a combination the type cannot hold, so the type's
guarantee and this boundary's are different laws at different places. Every
import, deserialization and restore comes through here.

**Three parameters, and the third is the one that makes it a function.** With
only a wire value and a profile, the decision would still depend on which
vocabularies happen to be readable — ambient state, so two holders could decode
identical bytes differently and nothing could adjudicate. `ResolutionSnapshot`
moves that into the signature. `Refused` is spelled as an exception here, which
is the sum's refusing arm: it returns no claim, and therefore no receipt.

**Retirement is not enforced here, deliberately** (§7.3a). This function sees
wire bytes and cannot tell a claim being authored now from a historical one being
restored from a backup, re-imported, or replayed from the mutation log. Refusing
a retired identifier would make every corpus holding a prior claim
un-restorable — corrupting exactly the history retirement exists to preserve. So
`build_claim` refuses withdrawn identifiers and this route does not, and that is
the only respect in which the two differ.

**`WireClaim` does not leave this module.** M13's second clause: no function
downstream of the boundary accepts one, because a downstream signature that did
would let unchecked data past the single place that checks it. The test for that
walks the package's own signatures rather than grepping for the name.
