"""Derive an assessment from one completed assessment run (R22, R7).

Computation §5.1 has one constructor: it resolves the run's frozen spec and
bound interpretation implementation, evaluates only the result manifest, and
derives every assessment facet. No facet is authored through this API.

Assessments have no revisions: changing the rule or applicability requires a
successor spec and a new run. Explicit import, raw-write, and audit negatives
remain deferred with the store and audit (cut 3 §4.2).
