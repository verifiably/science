"""Referent resolution: the five outcomes, the snapshot, and the receipt.

**Binding a referent is not the same as resolving one** (§7.2). A claim may
legitimately name an ontology term in a corpus that does not hold that ontology's
bytes, so "is this term in its vocabulary?" has more answers than yes and no.

D §5's `unknown` could not carry the decision, because it is a **disjunction**:
the term is outside the bound vocabulary, *or* nobody consulted the binding's
namespace. Refusing on it would report *"not in the vocabulary"* on the evidence
that no one looked. §7.2 splits it, and the resulting five outcomes fall into two
groups that must never be mixed:

    resolved membership results   member        not-member
    check not performed           not-consulted not-present  not-available

`not-member` is a **finding**; `not-consulted` is the absence of one. Only
`not-member` refuses at decode — the other four are well-formed states, and
refusing on them would make typing a claim require holding every ontology it
mentions.

*"A failure to look is not a finding of absence"* runs through five banked
documents; the accepting rows here are its **dual** — a failure to look is not a
finding of presence either, which is why an unperformed check is recorded as
unperformed rather than omitted.

**`not-present` is unreachable in this cut, and is defined anyway.** It means the
bound dataset has a world address the consulted index records while its corpus is
absent — which needs the world index and holding machinery that cut 1 does not
build (D3's deferred arm). Defining four of five would be implementing a
different closed set than the one §7.2 rules, and the gap would be invisible;
defining all five leaves exactly one outcome that nothing here constructs, which
is a fact a test can state.
