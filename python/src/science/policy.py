"""``science.belief.v1`` — the reference aggregation policy.

Belief-policy §2–§3: `V = ℤ`, prior `0`, distance `|a − b|`, unit weight, sum.
The value is a **signed evidence balance** — independent corroboration minus
effective contestation — and must **never be rendered as odds or a
probability** (belief-policy §3.1). Implementations use unbounded integers; a
fixed-width implementation that would overflow must **refuse**, not saturate
(§3.5).

The policy identity binds `aggregate` **end to end**, not a decomposition of
it (§2.1): every step of kernel §4.2.1's algorithm — the independent-set
selection, the contestation reduction, the clamp, the candidate ordering, the
tie-break — is normative, and a change to any of them changes belief. That is
what the fixture set below exists to pin (§2.2), and what P5 (see
`tests/test_aggregation.py`) exercises as a live check: an implementation that
smuggles in a per-assessment weight is a different policy, and must fail these
fixtures even though it is *called* `science.belief.v1`.
