"""The write API and the read side — the one module that holds a mutable corpus.

**S8's capability boundary is what this module's shape is for.** A `Corpus`
structurally satisfies any read-only `Protocol` despite carrying mutation
methods, so a protocol is not a capability boundary. What is one is a concrete
facade: `ReadView` holds its `Corpus` privately and exposes exactly the read
surface — `get`, one-hop `outbound`/`inbound`, and member iteration. Every module
outside this one receives a `ReadView`, and no mutable `Corpus` is constructed or
received anywhere else. That claim is checkable by AST, which is the point: a
roster of trusted writers has a hole by construction, and a new writer reaching
the filesystem through an unrecognized primitive is simply never discovered.

**Stale-hash validation lives on the facade's node-read path.** Every fetch —
`get`, and every node a traversal resolves — recomputes the semantic hash from
the stored fields and refuses a disagreement. Iteration is deliberately *not* a
fetch: the corpus check reads through it and must **report** what it finds
rather than raise, and a check that could not survive reaching a stale node
would report nothing about the corpus beyond it.

**A live `Corpus` indexes at construction, so a raw filesystem write is
invisible to it.** Every fixture that writes bytes behind the API reconstructs a
fresh facade before asserting read behaviour — reconstruction from disk is the
recovery posture the seam names, and it is the read this slice actually runs.

**Traversal is corpus-local throughout.** A walk truncates at the corpus edge;
reaching a target the holding corpus does not carry is the world index's, which
this slice does not build.

    admitted add, because nothing removes a basis or an `observes` edge, but the

    both no-clobber effects succeed. `CreateFileNoClobber` backstops only the
