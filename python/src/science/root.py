"""The composition root — the one module that imports `atoms`.

Science's durable corpus writes flow through the certified `atoms` engine, and
everything the engine needs that is not a plan is decided here: the volume
binding, the explicit root-registration act, the durable executor that compiles
one `nodes` write plan into one `TransactionSpec`, and the root-taking factory
the write API is built with (adapter design §1–§4).

**Why this module and no other.** `atoms` types are engine capability. Confining
their import to the composition root is an architecture rule, checked as one —
distinct from S8's capability boundary, which is about who holds a *mutable
corpus handle* and is checked over `science.corpus`. Two boundaries, two checks,
neither standing in for the other.

**The corpus supplies its own root.** The factory this module hands the write
API is `(root: Path) -> DurableExecutor`, using the module-bound backend and
storage profile and deriving the metadata root by §2's sibling rule. A
pre-bound executor would let the corpus write through a root it never verified.
