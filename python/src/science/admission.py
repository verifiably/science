"""The admission gate: where a constructed assessment meets eligibility.

Kernel §4.1's predicate over values: an `assesses` edge is admissible only if
its run has at least one `observes` input, **all** inputs are held under the
observations supplied to this call, and the assessment is in the admitted
verification state (§3.3). `reads` inputs never confer eligibility, in any
quantity (G6). A refusal is an **outcome**, not an error — the reasons stay
distinct so no gate can silently cover for another.

The gate takes declarations and observations and derives heldness itself; it
accepts no state value, because no API accepts an authored `held` (G9).
