/**
 * The compiled runtime profile, in the reduced form the shared-encoding path
 * needs: **resolution**, and the declarations a claim is typed against.
 *
 * `ProfileSpec` resolves; contracts authorize (§7.5). This side does the
 * resolving — local names become term identifiers, because a claim's projection
 * carries term identifiers and a local name is not one — and nothing else. In
 * particular there is **no `compiled_identity` here**: §8 sites claim-schema
 * compilation as Python-only, on the ground that compilation is not a shared
 * encoding and no parity obligation reaches it. Computing one here would be a
 * second implementation of something no row requires, and two implementations of
 * an identity nobody compares is how the identity drifts.
 *
 * **It is a branded class, not an interface.** A structurally typed profile can
 * be hand-authored, and a claim typed against a hand-authored profile is typed
 * against nothing: every operator, sort, layer and dimension in it was invented
 * by whoever wrote the object, and the contracts — the normative SSOT — were
 * never opened. The private field below is installed only by `compileProfile`,
 * so "this came from the contracts" is a runtime fact rather than a shape.
 *
 * A brand is only ever as good as what the minting function checks, and this one
 * was once worth nothing: `compileProfile` accepted structurally typed contracts,
 * so the brand certified that a function had run rather than that the documents
 * had been read. The contracts carry brands of their own (`contract.ts`), and
 * they are checked here. **Trust does not begin at a compiled artifact — it
 * begins at the authored document, and every link between has to hold.**
 *
 * Everything below is also **genuinely immutable**, which `readonly` is not:
 * `readonly`, `ReadonlyMap` and `ReadonlySet` are erased at run time, and both a
 * `Map`'s entries and a `Set`'s members are beyond the reach of `Object.freeze`.
 * A profile that could be edited after minting would carry a brand attesting to
 * a compilation whose result no longer exists.
