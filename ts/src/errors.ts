/**
 * The error hierarchy, mirroring the Python side's shape for the surface this

 *
 * One class has no Python counterpart and is the more important one:
 * `UncheckableContract`. `ts/` implements the **shared-encoding path** and not a
 * second system (D §9, formal model limitation 9), so there are contract
 * features it cannot validate — succession, and retirement's authoring
 * semantics. It **refuses** those inputs rather than parsing past them. A
 * reduced parser that quietly accepted what the other implementation refuses
 * would be a second, weaker reading of the normative source, which is exactly
 * the divergence a parity obligation exists to prevent.

 * compiled operator then carries them as facts — so compiling it against a
 * *different* base yields a claim on a layer that base does not declare.
 *
 * The general shape, worth remembering because provenance checks do not catch
 * it: authenticating each input separately says nothing about whether they
 * **belong together**. The rule is narrower than *"every stage records its
 * inputs"*, and both halves of it matter. It applies to an artifact whose
 * **validity is conditional** on a particular upstream artifact — some check it
 * passed was taken against that one and is never retaken — and which **may later
 * be recombined independently**, so it can arrive somewhere holding a different
 * partner. Such a boundary must **either verify a recorded dependency or
 * revalidate the relation**; a stage that rechecks what it depends on, or whose
 * output never travels apart from its input, owes neither.
