/**
 * `Claim` — the typed claim, and the only route to one, on this side too.
 *
 * M13's requirement is that a `Claim` is opaque and reachable only through a
 * validated construction, so that the profile-dependent checks happen **once**
 * and no downstream reader re-validates. That requirement is the claim's, not
 * Python's. A TypeScript path that accepted an object shaped like a claim would
 * exercise the encoding and skip the constructor, and the parity run would then
 * compare a four-stage path against a three-stage one.
 *
 * Three things make "opaque" true here, and none of them is `instanceof`: that
 * operator asks whether a prototype is on the chain, which a value can be given
 * without any constructor ever having run on it.
 *
 * * a **private-field brand** on each type, installed only by its constructor;
 * * a **mint token** on `Claim`, so the constructor is unreachable from outside;
 * * **genuinely immutable storage** — `readonly` and `ReadonlyMap` are erased at
 *   run time, so the qualifiers are held in a frozen null-prototype record and
 *   the arguments in a frozen array.
 *
 * None of it reaches further than the profile it is handed, and the profile
 * reaches no further than the contracts it was compiled from — see `profile.ts`
 * and `contract.ts` for the rest of the chain.
