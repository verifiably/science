/**
 * Every route past a type check that this implementation has been shown to have,
 * and the brands and freezes that close them.
 *
 * Each test below **was a working exploit** before the fix, and each produced a
 * value that reached `projectClaim` or `claimIdentity` — so each one is M13's
 * guarantee failing in a language where `instanceof` was never a check and
 * `readonly` was never a restriction.
 *
 * They arrived in two rounds, and the second round is the more instructive. The
 * first closed three forgeries of the *claim*; the second showed that closing
 * them had moved the forgery one link up the chain rather than ending it, since
 * a brand certifies only what its minting function checked. So the tests are
 * organized by link — value, claim, profile, contract — and the last is the
 * root: what a claim is ultimately typed against is an **authored document**,
 * and every link between the document and the claim has to hold or none of them
 * mean anything.
 *
 * The general lesson, recorded because it is not the Python one: there,
 * `isinstance` is forgeable only through `object.__new__`, which is the same act
 * as a raw write to disk — §6.3's third row, an audit finding rather than a
 * refusal. Here a derived constructor may `return` an object *instead of*
 * calling `super`, so a forgery needs no unusual call at all. The private-field
 * brand is therefore the load-bearing part on this side, and `readonly` is
 * decoration — while `Object.freeze`, which the first round called decoration
 * too, turns out to be load-bearing wherever a collection is held.
