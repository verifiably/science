Adopt the shared CLI vocabulary: vendor tools/cli.toml (and tools/cli_surface.py), make the parser conform, add the conformance test. The steps are Task 5 in the ops plan docs/plans/2026-09-20-cli-conventions.md (spec docs/specs/2026-09-20-cli-conventions-design.md). Waits for the ops table task ops-c9ecf0 to land on ops main; the ops step ops-d42ad6 tracks this piece.
