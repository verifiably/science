Filed by tt-latency on titan: the median of successful, uncontended, unwidened runs over the trailing window is over the limit in latency.toml (ops). The sci project is halted while this task is open: tasks start refuses new lower-priority work there. Each pair in a `breach:` note below is an obligation on the host it names. Fix the suite, then run `tt-latency verify <this id> --after <remedy timestamp>` on each host named; the task closes when verify exits 0, and the tasks done message carries its output.

Process: planned
